# Arcane Repository

Arcane Repository is a Fabric magic mod that adds a plethora of new useful magical items to the game. The main concept behind the mod is to encourage exploration by generating Artifacts and Relics of varying usefulness in preexisting structures.

Artifacts are non-wearable items with active effects that can be used by the player (like a sword), while Relics provide passive effects and can be equipped in their appropriate slot.

These items come in a few types: Petty, Lesser, Greater, Grand and Cursed, with the last being the strongest, but also adding penalties for using them. Lesser arcane items can be crafted easily, but the rest cannot, and must be found via exploration.

The crafting system uses Gems, which are found in their respective ores across the dimensions. Each gem has an attribute assigned to it.

Arcane Repository can be used with [PolyMC](https://theepicblock.github.io/PolyMc/) and [Polymer Auto Host](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) a server-side mod. I'd also recommend [Polydex](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex) and [PolydexBridge](https://modrinth.com/mod/polydex-bridge) + [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) for extra peace of mind. These mods are **not** dependencies!

Textures are WIP. If you have a better one that's licensed under MIT, feel free to submit a pull request!
